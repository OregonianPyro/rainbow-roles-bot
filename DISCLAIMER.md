Rainbow role bot...pretty e-z

## Note:
Rainbow roles bot have the pottentional to get you banned from the API for API spam. With that in mind, the only reason I programmed this was out of boredom, really. However, I did add a few 'safety' checks if you will:
1) The bot will only change each role's color once each hour.
2) The bot will not let you add more than 3 roles to be changed.
3) The bot will not login if it is in more than one guild.

These help to prevent it from spamming the API. However, if you alter this code in any way and use it which results in you getting banned from the API, that's on you.
